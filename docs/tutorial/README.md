## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- VS Code (recommended for debugging)
- Basic understanding of JSON and REST APIs
- Familiarity with async/await in Python

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the tutorial project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/mcp-setup-tutorial
   cd mcp-setup-tutorial
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the test server**:
   ```bash
   python simple_mcp_server/server.py
   ```

4. **Test the implementation**:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_server.py
   ```
