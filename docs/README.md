## Learning Path Recommendations

### For Complete Beginners
Start with the tutorial series in order:
1. Read Chapter 1 to understand MCP fundamentals
2. Follow Chapter 2 to learn protocol details
3. Work through Chapter 3 to build your first tools
4. Use the debugging guide when issues arise

### For Experienced Developers
Focus on specific areas of interest:
- **Protocol Implementation**: Chapters 1-3
- **Debugging and Testing**: Chapter 5 + debugging_guide.md
- **Production Deployment**: Chapters 6, 8, and 9
- **Advanced Features**: Chapter 7 for state management

### For Troubleshooting
When encountering issues:
1. Check the **debugging_guide.md** for common solutions
2. Review relevant tutorial chapters for detailed explanations
3. Examine the **project_creation.md** for implementation insights
4. Use the VS Code debugging setup from Chapter 5

## Documentation Standards

All documentation in this project follows these principles:
