# MCP Server Tutorial - Learning Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a **learning and debugging project** designed to understand the Model Context Protocol (MCP) from the ground up. The goal is to create a minimal, well-documented MCP server that can be used to understand the entire MCP lifecycle and serve as a comprehensive tutorial for others learning MCP development.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Understanding MCP Architecture
- **Client-Server Communication**: How MCP clients (like Claude Desktop) communicate with MCP servers
- **Protocol Flow**: The complete request/response cycle from client connection to command execution
- **Authentication**: How MCP servers authenticate and authorize requests
- **Tool Registration**: How tools are defined, registered, and exposed to clients
- **Error Handling**: How errors are communicated between client and server

### 2. MCP Server Development
- **Server Structure**: How to organize an MCP server codebase
- **Tool Definition**: How to define tools with proper schemas and validation
- **Handler Implementation**: How to implement tool handlers that process requests
- **State Management**: How to manage server state and resources
- **Initialization**: How servers initialize and register with the MCP system

### 3. Development and Debugging
- **VS Code Integration**: Setting up `.vscode/launch.json` for debugging MCP servers
- **Breakpoint Debugging**: How to set breakpoints and step through MCP server code
- **Variable Inspection**: How to inspect MCP request/response objects and server state
- **Logging**: Implementing comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Error Diagnosis**: How to diagnose and fix common MCP server issues

### 4. Client-Side Integration
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: How Claude Desktop discovers and connects to MCP servers
- **Configuration**: How to configure MCP servers in Claude Desktop
- **Connection Issues**: Diagnosing why servers aren't recognized or commands aren't appearing
- **Communication Debugging**: Understanding the client-server communication flow

## Current Challenge

When learning MCP development, common challenges include:
- Understanding how MCP servers register and expose tools
- Debugging why tools don't appear in Claude Desktop
- Learning the proper structure and patterns for MCP servers
- Understanding the client-server communication flow

## Tutorial Project Goals

### Phase 1: Minimal MCP Server
Create the simplest possible MCP server that:
- Registers with Claude Desktop successfully
- Exposes a single "hello_world" tool
- Can be debugged with VS Code breakpoints
- Logs all MCP protocol interactions

### Phase 2: Tool Registration Deep Dive
Expand the server to understand:
- How tools are defined and registered
- How tool schemas work
- How to dynamically add/remove tools
- How client discovery works

### Phase 3: Debugging Infrastructure
Set up comprehensive debugging:
- VS Code launch configuration for MCP servers
- Logging system that captures all MCP interactions
- Error handling and reporting
- Performance monitoring

### Phase 4: Client-Server Communication Analysis
Understand the complete flow:
- How Claude Desktop discovers MCP servers
- The handshake and initialization process
- Request/response message formats
- Error propagation and handling
